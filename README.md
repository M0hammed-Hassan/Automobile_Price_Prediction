- Most cars use gas and few cars use diesel, we can say that's because cars which use diesel it's price almost from 7000 to 32000 compare to cars which use gas, it's price almost from 5000 to 25000.
- Most cars use 4 cylinders, and it's price almost from 5000 to 19000.
- The average of cars price almost equal to 13207.
- By using mean absolute error, actual prediction almost equal to ±2588 of predicted value.
- By using root mean squared error, actual prediction almost equal to ±4437 of predicted value.
